# Zekke

[zekke.io](https://zekke.io)

Zekke is an encrypted personal drive: passwords, account details, private notes, long-form
documents. You keep them encrypted. If you lose access, people you chose can help you back in.

Nobody at Zekke can read any of it. Not because of a policy, but because the servers never
receive anything readable. This repository is the web client — the part that runs in your browser
and does all the encryption and decryption. Everything else is storage.

## The problem

Password managers protect you while you are alive and paying attention. They are bad at two
things.

**Losing access.** Forget the master password on a properly encrypted vault and it is gone. The
provider cannot help without holding a key, and if they hold a key they can read your data.

Zekke treats that as an encryption problem rather than a customer support problem. Nobody at
Zekke holds a key that could help — or that could be compelled. The trade is stated plainly
rather than hidden: **what you hold is what you have**, and the app's job is to make sure you
know that before you need it, not after.

## How it works

### Your recovery phrase is the account

When you start, the app generates a phrase of 12 or 24 ordinary English words. That phrase is not
a password you can reset. It _is_ the account. Every key Zekke uses is calculated from it, the
same way every time, on any device.

That has a good consequence and a hard one. The good one: type the phrase into a new browser and
your vault is there, with no account recovery process and nothing to ask permission for. The hard
one: the phrase cannot be reissued. Write it down and store it somewhere physical.

Your account name is a fingerprint of the phrase — a long string of hex characters. The math runs
one way only, so the server can recognise your account without ever learning the words behind it.

### What the server can and cannot see

Everything is encrypted in your browser before it is sent. The server receives sealed data and
stores it.

It can see: that your account exists, how many items you have, roughly how large they are, and
when they changed.

It cannot see: your recovery phrase, your PIN, or any item's contents. Even the labels you write
are encrypted.

This is why "we cannot read your data" is checkable rather than a promise. The code that would do
the reading is in this repository, and there is no key on the server side to do it with.

### Your devices

Your recovery phrase is not stored anywhere, not even in your browser. Each browser you use
becomes one of your **devices**, with keys of its own that never leave it. You type the phrase
only to create the account, to add a device, and for account-level actions such as removing a
lost device or deleting the account. While you type it, it is in the page's memory; the rest of
the time the browser holds only its own keys. For the best protection, use Brave with a profile
that has no extensions.

A device you lose can be removed from any other device. Removal changes every key it held, so it
cannot read anything saved afterwards. It keeps whatever it had already copied: nothing can reach
into a device that is gone.

### Unlocking a device

Each browser has a 6-digit PIN. It unlocks that browser on a reload and after fifteen idle
minutes. The PIN never leaves the device: the server helps check it without ever seeing it, and
allows only a limited number of wrong tries. After the last one, the browser forgets your account
and your recovery phrase adds it back. Your vault is untouched either way.

You also choose a mode:

- **Standard** — your recovery phrase alone can add a device. A deliberate choice: nothing but
  losing your phrase can lock you out.
- **Paranoid** — your phrase also needs an **account PIN** before it can add a device or delete
  the account. Someone who steals your phrase still cannot get in. **Forgetting the account PIN
  ends the account.** There is no reset, by anyone, ever.

You can move from Standard to Paranoid later, but **never the reverse**: a stolen phrase must not
be able to switch protection off.

### There is no account recovery, and that is the design

An earlier version of Zekke let people you nominated hold pieces of a key that could rebuild your
phrase. It was removed on 2026-09-04, and the reasoning is worth stating rather than hiding:

- A guardian had to already have a Zekke account, so the feature only worked for people whose
  friends had already installed an unfamiliar app and written down a seed phrase of their own.
- "Your friends can restore your access" is the sentence that makes a privacy-minded reader ask
  who else can get in. For a product whose whole claim is that nobody can, the answer has to stay
  _nobody_.

So: **your phrase and your PIN are yours to keep.** In exchange, the answer to "who else could get
into my vault" is nothing, with no asterisk. The app's obligation is to be honest about that
up front — a printable kit at sign-up, plain words before you turn on Paranoid mode, and a later
nudge to check that the copy you saved is the copy that works.

### Why post-quantum

A vault runs on a timescale of decades. Encrypted data captured today can be stored and attacked
later, and a sufficiently capable quantum computer would break the classical algorithms in common
use now.

Your vault at rest does not depend on those algorithms: it is sealed with symmetric encryption,
which a quantum computer weakens but does not break. The hybrid construction matters for the other
case — **encrypting something for another person**, where the classical algorithms are what a
future attacker would target. So when Zekke wraps a key for someone else, it uses two independent
algorithms at once and combines them: one well-understood classical choice, one post-quantum
standard. An attacker has to break **both**.

That machinery is built, frozen and tested against fixed vectors. It has no caller at the moment —
private sharing, where you send one item to another person, is what will use it next.

## Running it locally

Requires Node and a running instance of the [Zekke API](../api-general).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

Point the client at your API in `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
NEXT_PUBLIC_BILLING_URL=http://localhost:8070
```

Both default to the values above. The billing service is where plans are bought; the CSP names its
origin.

The drive uploads and downloads straight from the object store, and the Content Security Policy
only lets the page talk to hosts it names. Add the API's `R2_ENDPOINT` as well:

```bash
CSP_OBJECT_STORE_ORIGINS=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
```

Without it the development server blocks every drive transfer and says so in the console, and
**a production build refuses to finish** — on Vercel, set it for every environment. See
[`lib/security-headers`](./src/lib/security-headers/README.md).

```bash
npm test      # 469 tests
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## For developers

Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript in strict mode, Tailwind v4. Cryptography is
[@noble](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-curves) plus the Web Crypto API.

Start with [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md). It carries the rules this codebase is built to and the
precedence order when documents disagree: the frozen specifications win on byte layouts and
constants, [front-end-guide.md](./front-end-guide.md) and
[front-end-endpoints.md](./front-end-endpoints.md) win on the wire contract.

### Dependency overrides

`package.json` carries three `overrides`, added on 2026-09-13 so that `npm audit --omit=dev`
reports nothing:

| Override                    | Why                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `next` → `postcss: ^8.5.25` | `next@15.5.25` pins `postcss` at exactly `8.4.31`, which has four advisories (XSS in stringify, source-map file reads). Only a minor version separates them, and the build is verified under it |
| `nanoid: ^3.3.18`           | `3.3.17`, pulled in by `postcss`, can loop forever on a zero size                                                                                                                               |
| `sharp: ^0.35.4`            | `0.34.5` inherits libvips and libheif CVEs. `0.35.4` is inside the range `next` itself declares                                                                                                 |

**Delete an override when its parent stops needing it**: when `next` no longer pins an old
`postcss`, which Next 16 already does not, or when `npm ls` shows the natural resolution is at or
above the override. An override left behind silently holds a package back later.

After changing one, `npm ls postcss sharp nanoid` must show no `invalid` entry. A nested override
does not replace a package the lockfile already records under that parent: delete that lock entry
and reinstall.

The test suite includes a fixture that reproduces every key derivation against values generated by
the backend. No backend test reads that file, so this suite is the only cross-client check that
these derivations are correct anywhere in the project. Keep it green.

One note for anyone auditing: Zekke has no secp256k1 key and no Ethereum account. The key
derivation path reserves that branch and never derives from it.
